# MIA-Sig

MIA-Sig is designed to 'extract true signal' in multiplex chromatin interaction data by filtering out noise. 

It has been tested on ChIA-Drop and RNAPII ChIA-Drop (Zheng et al., 2019) data, and can potentially be applied to GAM (Beagerie et al., 2017) and SPRITE (Quinodoz et al., 2018) data.
